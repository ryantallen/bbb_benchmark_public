When asked to make a decision for the upcoming year, please format your output as follows: 1) Total forecasted AGM units for the upcoming year (in Millions of Units), 2) Total forecasted Supercapacitor (SC) units for next year (in Millions of Units), 3) Desired AGM price for the upcoming year (in $/unit), 4) Desired SC price for the upcoming year (in $/unit), 5) Exact allocation of R&D dollars for each of the five R&D areas for AGM in the upcoming year (in $M), 6) Exact allocation of R&D dollars for each of the five R&D areas for SC in the upcoming year (in $M). For all of the above, please provide the exact dollar amount, not a percentage. You should include only the numbers, no other text. So the results will just be a list of 14 comma‑separated numbers: AGM units (in Millions), SC units (in Millions), AGM price (in $/unit), SC price (in $/unit), R&D dollar allocations for 5 AGM areas (in $M), R&D dollar allocations for 5 SC areas (in $M) After listing just the numbers, provide a brief description of your reasoning and overall strategy.
